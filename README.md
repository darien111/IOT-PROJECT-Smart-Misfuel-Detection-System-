## 📚 How It Works

The Smart Misfuel Detection System works by analyzing the color properties of the fuel being dispensed. It is equipped with the TCS3200 color sensor, which accurately captures the color information of the fuel. By comparing this data with predefined color profiles of Diesel and Petrol, the system can determine the type of fuel being pumped.

## 🔧 Building the System

To build the Smart Misfuel Detection System, follow these steps:

1. Gather all the necessary components, including the TCS3200 color sensor, Arduino board, and other electronic components.
2. Connect the TCS3200 color sensor to the Arduino board following the provided wiring diagram.
3. Upload the system's firmware to the Arduino board.
4. Calibrate the color sensor to accurately detect Diesel and Petrol based on their color properties.
5. Test the system by dispensing Diesel and Petrol and verifying the detection accuracy.
